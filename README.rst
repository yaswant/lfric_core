LFRic Core
==========
[![Docs](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_core/actions/workflows/sphinx.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_core/actions/workflows/sphinx.yml)

Location for LFRic infrastructure documentation. Once the great repository split
has occurred the actual source code may join it.

To build the sphinx docs you can use the normal LFRic environment (it contains
Sphinx and the required packages as PSyclone needs them), building is done with 
`make html` in the documentation directory. `make help` will give you the other 
options available.
